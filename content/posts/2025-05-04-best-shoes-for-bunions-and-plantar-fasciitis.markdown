## Conclusion
I hope that this review on the best shoes for bunions and plantar fasciitis has been helpful to you. Just a reminder, when buying bunions and plantar fasciitis shoes, you need to look for features like roomy toe box to accommodate bunions. Shoes with a deep or firm heel cup, excellent arch support, cushioning, and ability to absorb shock are ideal for people with plantar fasciitis.

Luckily, all the reviewed shoes above have a combination of all these features. Therefore, choosing either of them will help you deal with pain caused by plantar fasciitis and bunions.
