The removable Ortholite sock liner prevents odors thanks to the anti-bacterial element that helps to keep the feet healthy and fresh throughout. The sock liner also provides extra underfoot cushioning.

The midsole unit of Salomon Speedcross 4 utilizes a molded EVA foam, which acts as the main cushioning system. The foam provides protection against rough terrains and a hard impact that might affect the knees. This cushioning system also promotes smooth transitions throughout the gait cycle.

Moreover, the outsole utilizes the Contagrip rubber compound, which provides excellent traction on various surfaces including wet, slippery, hard, and soft surfaces. The 6mm lugs provide an unmatched multi-directional grip on tough terrains.
