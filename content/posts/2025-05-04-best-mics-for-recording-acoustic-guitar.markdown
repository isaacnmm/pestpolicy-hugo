It has been around for decades and still proves to be one of the best mics for acoustic guitars. At the core of its strength is the cardioid condenser which readily selects the signals to pick.
With the unidirectional sound pick-up, this mic effectively picks sounds from the acoustic guitar, therefore, giving an accurate and warm output. Its low noise configuration also helps in ensuring you get a very clear sound.
SM81 uses an effective off-axis response system where sounds hitting the membrane at an angle are effectively canceled. This is made possible due to the use of a small membrane as opposed to a large one.
It’s capable of handling a wide range of frequencies. Whether you’re fingerpicking or strumming, this mic captures all the tones made by an acoustic guitar. You can also use it with cymbals and piano.
Since it uses a small diaphragm, it weighs only 1.63-pounds which makes it very convenient to position for maximum sound output.
