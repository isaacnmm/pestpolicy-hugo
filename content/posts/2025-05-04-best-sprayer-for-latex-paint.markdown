## Considerations for Best Sprayer for Latex Paint
### 1. Adjustable settings and Paint flow control
If you are dealing with latex paint, you need the flexibility to change the spray speed, the thickness of the spray, and the pattern quickly and conveniently.
This feature allows you to adapt to different surfaces to achieve the desired effect. This feature offers you unlimited flexibility which is just what you need for all your projects.
The ideal pick of spray painter should minimize wastage and offer you greater control over all your projects by providing less over-spray with a wide range of coatings.
### 2. Size
The size of spray painters ranges from handheld devices to a small vacuum cleaner. The preferred type depends on whether you plan on using it indoors or outdoors, which in turn determines the size.
Whereas a smaller product is deemed suitable for indoor use, a powerful sprayer capable of covering walls and ceilings means you have to go for a bigger unit.
### 3. Weight
The weight of the tool comes down to the materials used in its construction. Whereas high-end sprayers utilize heavy-duty material in their construction, most portable paint sprayers are made of plastic.
Weight is an important consideration if your paint projects entail moving around. If you are dealing with a medium-term project, it is imperative to strike a balance between power and weight features.
### 4. Capacity of spray can
This factor is closely interrelated to the size and weight features. The amount of paint the can hold is an important consideration particularly if you are dealing with medium or large surfaces.
The larger the can the less often you will need to refill the can. Larger capacities of spray canisters tend to be heavier. Overall, it comes down to the personal preferences of the user.
### 5. Spray tip and Motor power
You might want to ensure that the spray tip fits right since you are dealing with latex paint. With the availability of a wide variety in the market, it comes down to personal preferences when choosing the desired spray pattern.
You might want to go for a sprayer with a powerful motor if you are looking to achieve improved precision as well as sufficient coverage on larger surfaces for that sought after professional look.
## Conclusion
The best latex sprayer should be capable of giving you a smooth and even coverage. Latex paint is particularly preferable due to its nontoxic nature particularly for DIYers looking to maintain an eco-friendly life.
Our featured list offers you different options to choose from depending on the size of your project, budget, and versatility.
In specific, the Graco Magnum 262805 X7 Cart true airless sprayer stands out from the rest because it allows you to apply a wide range of coating from heavy latex to other forms of stubborn stains.
