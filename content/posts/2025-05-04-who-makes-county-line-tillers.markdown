## Why County Line Rotary Tiller Doesn’t Spin with PTO Shaft?
Definitely, I would say that the section between the tiller’s gearbox and the tractor’s PTO shaft is the issue. For example, I would check if only the friction clutch is freely spinning around the tiller’s gearbox shaft.
- First, if that’s the case, this could be our main problem here. However, I would also say that the clutch might be faulty – one if there are no fiber plates that you can see in-between.
- These could have worn out if you left the pack to carelessly loosen.
Further, to rectify the situation, we may need to tighten the 6 or so bolts that are on the connection.
However, ensure that you tighten each of the bolts using almost an equal amount of force to ensure that each of them exerts an even amount of pressure on the connection.
Also, probably the drive chain might have jumped off – so you’ll require to examine the clutch pack.

## Conclusion
Check if the clutch packs tend to rotate without turning the shaft half you should know that the clutch pack has a problem.
However, ensure that the tractor is switched off while you’re working on the PTO equipment.
