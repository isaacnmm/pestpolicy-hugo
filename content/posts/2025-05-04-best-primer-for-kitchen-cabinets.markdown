## s: Top 7 Best Primer for Kitchen Cabinets in 2025
### [1. Rust-Oleum Primer, 2004 Zinsser Bulls Eye](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H5VKBQ/?tag=p-policy-20)
This is one of the most highly sort after primer due to its multiple benefits and adhesiveness.

Formulated as a water-based primer, Rust-Oleum 2004 sticks to multiple surfaces, including tile and metal surfaces, without the requirement of sanding.
Interestingly you can use this primer on almost all exterior and interior surfaces. Its rustproof ability makes it ideal for applying on metal surfaces and exterior surfaces exposed to harsh weather.
Additionally, it inhibits blistering, peeling off, and well mildew growth making it one of the best primers to own - and hence it's approved for
[remodeling your cabinets](https://www.housebeautiful.com/home-remodeling/g3813/kitchen-makeovers/)
.
What is so exceptional about this product is that it makes an excellent choice for PH surfaces, including concretes, and works well on glossy surfaces like enameled trim and tiles. The result is ultimately a surface easy to clean with water and soap.
The primer I packaged in a quart can cover at least 100 square ft. However, with these primers, you may be required to apply more than two coats to achieve the desired surface.

When applying, you can either

This primer is formulated to block many stains and seal smoke, water, and nicotine stains. It is versatile - it works like a glass primer, tile primer, concrete primer, and

On exterior surfaces, this primer is mostly preferred for its great flexibility and penetration on surfaces.
Apart from the new constructions, you can also use them for remodeling,
[repainting a cabinet](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-paint-bathroom-cabinets/)
, or prime other projects.
Similarly, its preference for interior surfaces is due to its fast-drying feature and providing undercoat enamel.
In the case of redwood bleeding, dark colors, and stains, Zinsser primer is all you need for an excellent job.
On using this primer, it takes 8 hours to dry before a second coat is applied, and in the case of imperfections, sandpaper can be used to achieve a clean, smooth surface.

### [5. Zinsser B-I-N Shellac-Base Primer, 1-Gallon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000C02C68/?tag=p-policy-20)
Zinsser B-I-N is an oil-based primer that can be used both on the interior and exterior surfaces- such as on
[new or old metal surfaces](https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-for-metal-garage-door/)
.

[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MV8MWEQ/?tag=p-policy-20)
It is best known to cover stains better than all other oil and latex-based
[paint](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-thin-latex-paint-for-hvlp/)
. Similarly, it is also known to cover smoke, moldy odor, and pet stains.
It can be best achieved through prior priming before painting or topcoats on your kitchen cabinet. You can apply this primer on all surfaces, which sticks well even without sanding required.
It is important to note that the Zinsser B-I-N primer has strong fumes and must be applied when in a well-ventilated area.
Similarly,
[use a brush](https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-brushes-for-latex-paint/)
and avoid spraying the primer since this will increase the fumes in the environment, which is hazardous.
For such cases, ensure you put on gas masks or respirators whenever applying this primer to avoid inhaling the fumes.

It is formulated with adherent ability to glossy surfaces and creates a hard film on challenging and tough surfaces.
However, this primer is not recommended for polypropylene, and such a strong topcoat must be used - it

, smoke, and water from seeping.
If you are experiencing a challenge of tough stains and smell in your kitchen cabinets, this primer will be a good reproof for you.
I like this primer because it adheres to almost all rigid surfaces and cures into challenging films with enamel holdouts, has quick resistance to cracking and blistering, and a smooth leveling.
