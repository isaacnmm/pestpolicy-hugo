### [1. Rust-Oleum Primer, 2004 Zinsser Bulls Eye](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H5VKBQ/?tag=p-policy-20)

Formulated as a water-based primer, Rust-Oleum 2004 sticks to multiple surfaces, including tile and metal surfaces, without the requirement of sanding.
Interestingly you can use this primer on almost all exterior and interior surfaces. Its rustproof ability makes it ideal for applying on metal surfaces and exterior surfaces exposed to harsh weather.
Additionally, it inhibits blistering, peeling off, and well mildew growth making it one of the best primers to own - and hence it's approved for
[remodeling your cabinets](https://www.housebeautiful.com/home-remodeling/g3813/kitchen-makeovers/)
.
What is so exceptional about this product is that it makes an excellent choice for PH surfaces, including concretes, and works well on glossy surfaces like enameled trim and tiles. The result is ultimately a surface easy to clean with water and soap.
The primer I packaged in a quart can cover at least 100 square ft. However, with these primers, you may be required to apply more than two coats to achieve the desired surface.

On exterior surfaces, this primer is mostly preferred for its great flexibility and penetration on surfaces.
Apart from the new constructions, you can also use them for remodeling,

### [5. Zinsser B-I-N Shellac-Base Primer, 1-Gallon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000C02C68/?tag=p-policy-20)
Zinsser B-I-N is an oil-based primer that can be used both on the interior and exterior surfaces- such as on
[new or old metal surfaces](https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-for-metal-garage-door/)
.

It is best known to cover stains better than all other oil and latex-based
[paint](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-thin-latex-paint-for-hvlp/)
. Similarly, it is also known to cover smoke, moldy odor, and pet stains.
It can be best achieved through prior priming before painting or topcoats on your kitchen cabinet. You can apply this primer on all surfaces, which sticks well even without sanding required.
It is important to note that the Zinsser B-I-N primer has strong fumes and must be applied when in a well-ventilated area.
Similarly,
[use a brush](https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-brushes-for-latex-paint/)
and avoid spraying the primer since this will increase the fumes in the environment, which is hazardous.
For such cases, ensure you put on gas masks or respirators whenever applying this primer to avoid inhaling the fumes.

It is formulated with adherent ability to glossy surfaces and creates a hard film on challenging and tough surfaces.

If you are experiencing a challenge of tough stains and smell in your kitchen cabinets, this primer will be a good reproof for you.
