APC40 Mk2 is built mainly to playback clips with Live session. With the RGB, you can get color feedback from the different assignable colors in the Live session. Luckily, you can color-code various clips to you match your taste.
You can assign channels to its crossfader on both sides easily in addition to having a Session Record button. APC40 Mk2 has a tempo control knob that is dedicated just like the Nudge and Tap Tempo buttons, and this simplifies Live set mixing. Further, to prevent accidental activation, APC40 Mk2 has smaller Clip Stop buttons.
Also, the 8 endless rotary knobs have been moved to just above APC40 Mk2’s channel strips – and for starters, it’s used to control sends and pans. Luckily, this APC40 Mk2 is USB powered and thus highly portable – compared to its predecessor that needed a large wall-wart.

Thus you won’t have to separately purchase a drum pad or control surface with faddles. It has transport control – so you can go between your tracks, record, start-stop, etc. Also, it has two amazing pitch and mode view.
You hit the auto function, on Ableton, you can quickly go through various tracks on the set – drums, bass guitars, vocals, etc. You can control the levels of various tracks using the controller.
It's possible to control different effects parameters - delays, EQs, Reverbs, etc. Simply program beats using the velocity-sensitive pads. So, just plug in the controller, have the software installed and you’re set to go.
Also, the transport controls allow one to press stop or play and record with no mouse. Its keys are soft which makes it have the feel of a normal electronic/ synthesizer keyboard.
Its synth-weighted keys have a great feeling using. This controller has 8 drum pads that are great to touch. It has standard rotary knobs (8 in total), the endless type of knobs that are amazing for live shows and concerts.
