Are you looking for the best weed barrier under gravel? Well, I’ve covered it all below.

In fact, weeds will compete aggressively with your garden grass for sunlight, nutrients, and water – leading to weaker plants like lavender or strawberries.

The weed barrier is recommended by government agencies and top landscape architects.
Dewitt PRO-5 will prevent weed germination and growth in addition to helping conserve the soil moisture. The colored lines that are 12-inched will allow you to easily align your flowers and plants.

### [3. Scotts 25-Year (3 by 150-Feet) Pro Fabric](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LK2MJ9M/?tag=p-policy-20)
SCOTT’s 25-Year Pro is a durable and strong weed barrier but it’s not heavy that it won’t be easy to roll over in your yard and under the gravel.
The fabric is easy to cut yet strong enough to withstand tear and install for most garden owners. However, you can spread a mulch layer on the weed barrier.
It measures 3 feet by 150-feet – it’s big enough a barrier for under gravel.
Also, the material is quality despite coming with the flimsy plastic feel – it’ll take your staples readily. However, it lacks print lines that would guide one to follow a straight edge.
SCOTT’s 25-Year Pro, like its name suggests, can last for about 25 years. Luckily, the fabric will block weeds but equally leave the water to seek through its woven surface.
However, the weed barrier is not thick enough and so it might tear – but you can cut it with minimal effort.
You’ll need to remove gravel and mulch regularly while also brushing the weed barrier – this will allow the unit to last for the promised 25 years of good weed blocking. However, SCOTT’s 25-Year Pro is not UV-resistant.

## Conclusion
Weed barriers will prevent weeds from encroaching your plants – particularly under gravel, allowing air and moisture.
They enable the soil to breathe, reduce nutrient leaching, and prevent water evaporation. Finally, I’ve reviewed the top weed Barrier under Gravel.
- The key point to note is that your chosen unit must have a material that’s highly permeable to water.
However, it must not be overly absorbent as this might allow weeds to overgrow.
