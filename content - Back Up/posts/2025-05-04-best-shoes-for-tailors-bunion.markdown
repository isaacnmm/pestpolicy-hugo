The Best Shoes for Tailor’s Bunion or bunionette should have a wide and spacious toe box to accommodate the tailor bunion.

The shoes should also feature flexible uppers with soft interior lining to prevent pressure on the little toe. A well-cushioned footbed or insole will absorb impact and protect the feet from unnecessary pressure.

Therefore investing in the right type of footwear will help you deal with the tailor's bunion.
